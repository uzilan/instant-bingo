# Instant Bingo 2 - Application Overview

## Concept

Instant Bingo 2 is a collaborative bingo application designed for small groups (1-few players) to create custom bingo games with unique categories and items. The application allows users to create games, invite others, collaboratively build item lists, and play bingo in real-time.

## Core Features

### Game Creation & Setup
- **Flexible Board Sizes**: Support for different grid sizes (3x3, 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, etc.)
- **Custom Categories**: Users define their own categories (e.g., "Movies", "Food", "Travel destinations")
- **No Predefined Content**: Application provides no suggestions - complete user freedom
- **Game Owner**: Creator manages the game setup and can start the game

### Invitation System
- **Multiple Invitation Methods**:
  - Email links
  - QR codes
  - Number codes (invite codes)
- **Real-time Joining**: Players can join until the game starts
- **No Player Limits**: Dynamic player count until game starts

### Collaborative Item Creation
- **Two Game Modes**:
  - **Joined List**: All users agree on a shared list of items
  - **Individual Lists**: Each user creates their own private list (hidden until game starts)
- **Individual Mode Features**:
  - **Private Lists**: Each player's items are hidden from others
  - **Item Count Visibility**: All players can see how many items each person has added
  - **Coordination**: Players can coordinate to ensure everyone has enough items
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Firebase handles live updates
- **Item Validation**: Must have enough items to fill the board (e.g., 25 items for 5x5)
- **No Editing After Start**: Once game starts, items are locked
- **Automatic Board Generation**: When game starts, boards are created with random item placement
- **Shared Progress**: All users can see everyone's boards and progress

### Game States
1. **Creating**: Game setup phase - adding items, inviting players
2. **Active**: Game is being played - no more changes allowed
3. **Completed**: Game is finished - view results

### Gameplay
- **Self-Marking**: Players mark items themselves as they encounter them in real life
- **Real-time Updates**: When one player marks an item, others see it immediately
- **Win Conditions**: First player to complete a line/pattern wins
- **Mobile-Optimized**: Touch-friendly interface for mobile devices

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **React 19** with TypeScript
- **Material-UI (MUI)** for components and theming
- **Dark Mode Only**: Consistent dark theme throughout
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for mobile devices
- **Vite**: Fast development and building

### Backend & Data
- **Firebase**: Real-time synchronization and data storage
- **Game Isolation**: Each game is completely separate
- **No Shared Content**: No predefined categories or items

### Key Components
- **GamesOverview**: Main screen showing all games
- **GameCreationForm**: Form for creating new games
- **GameDetailScreen**: Detailed view of a specific game
- **BingoBoard**: The actual bingo game interface
- **InviteDetails**: Reusable component for sharing games

## User Flow

### Game Creation Flow
1. **Create Game**: User selects board size, category, and game mode
2. **Generate Invite**: System creates invitation code/link
3. **Share Invitations**: Owner shares with other players
4. **Item Creation**:
   - **Joined Mode**: All players collaboratively add items to shared list
   - **Individual Mode**: Each player creates their own private list
5. **Start Game**: Owner validates and starts the game
6. **Board Generation**: System creates random boards for all players
7. **Play**: Real-time bingo gameplay with shared progress

### Game Joining Flow
1. **Receive Invitation**: Via email, QR code, or number code
2. **Join Game**: Enter code or scan QR
3. **Add Items**:
   - **Joined Mode**: Contribute to shared item list
   - **Individual Mode**: Create your own private list
4. **Wait for Start**: Game owner starts when ready
5. **Board Generation**: System creates your random board
6. **Play**: Participate in real-time gameplay with shared progress

## Design Principles
